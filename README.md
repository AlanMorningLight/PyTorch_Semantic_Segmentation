# 3D_Task_PyTorch
### Introduction

1. This repo includes some networks for **3D Classification, 3D Part Segmentation, 3D Semantic Segmentation** and etc. implemented in **pytorch 0.4.0** and **python3**. See each directory for more information.
2. I **only provide architecture of network** here. Dataset and train/test files aren't available here, for I think  it can be added according to individual needs.
3. The code file containing the network structure can be **run directly** with the set simulation data.
4. Has finished: **PointNet**(CVPR 2017), **3DGNN**(ICCV 2017)
